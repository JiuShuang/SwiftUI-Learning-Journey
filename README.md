# SwiftUI-Learning-Journey

A dedicated repository for SwiftUI practice — focusing on UI implementation, basic component usage, and core layout techniques. It’s ideal for tracking my progress as I learn and experiment with SwiftUI’s declarative syntax.

## What’s Inside?
This repo includes small code snippets and mini-projects centered around:
- SwiftUI basic components (Text, Button, Image, List, etc.)
- Layout fundamentals (VStack, HStack, ZStack, Spacer, Padding)
- Simple UI interactions and state management
- Custom view styling and reusable components
- Practical examples of common UI patterns

## Notes
- This is a personal learning repo — code is simplified for clarity, focusing on UI implementation logic.
- Regularly updated as I explore new SwiftUI features, gradually accumulating practical experience.
- Feel free to fork or use the code for your own practice, and welcome to share learning ideas!

## Tech Stack
- Primary Framework: SwiftUI
- Programming Language: Swift
- Supported Platforms: iOS / macOS
